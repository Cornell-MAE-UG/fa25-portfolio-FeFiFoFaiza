## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpeg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}


My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m a junior Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University with hands-on experience in robotics, fluid mechanics, manufacturing, and experimental prototyping. My background spans designing planetary rover systems, engineering bio-inspired fluid devices, and fabricating high-precision hardware with manual and CNC machining. I’ve worked on projects including rover drivetrain and suspension design, auger and end effector collection mechanisms, custom wheel fabrication, environmental sensor integration, chemical analysis flow systems, and capillary flow analysis in custom sponges. Additionally, I’ve undertaken personal engineering projects such as disassembling a 6-cylinder forklift engine and designing a quadcopter. Across these experiences, I’ve leveraged CAD, FEA, 3D printing, sensor integration, and system-level design thinking to solve complex, real-world engineering challenges. I’m passionate about building functional, reliable hardware systems and excited to contribute to innovation in robotics and aerospace mechanical systems.
