For the Cornell Mars Rover, I designed a soil-sampling auger optimized for extracting granular regolith under simulated Martian conditions. The system focused on torque efficiency, abrasion-resistant materials, and consistent operation in dust-rich and low-pressure environments.

Key Accomplishments

- Engineered an auger mechanism capable of sustaining over 50 Nm of torque while minimizing motor current draw.

- Designed a sealed sample cache to maintain environmental isolation and prevent contamination during transport.

- Built a mixing chamber that homogenizes collected regolith to ensure consistent downstream chemical or mechanical analysis.

- Performed FEA on auger flutes, driveshaft interfaces, and load-bearing features to validate stress limits and fatigue life.

- Increased overall sampling efficiency by approximately 20% through optimized pitch angle and flute geometry.

This system was integrated into the rover’s sampling assembly and tested using basaltic soil analogs, demonstrating reliable performance over repeated drilling cycles.
