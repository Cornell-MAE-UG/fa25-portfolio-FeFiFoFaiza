During my internship at the Emerson Machining Shop, I created a comprehensive training curriculum aimed at improving user safety and technical competency across the shop’s core equipment, including CNC mills, manual mills, lathes, drill presses, and saws.

Key Accomplishments

- Authored and illustrated detailed instructional guides covering machine setup, tool selection, measurement techniques, and emergency procedures.

- Standardized certification requirements, enabling efficient onboarding of over 200 new users.

- Reduced average training time by 30% by restructuring modules and improving content clarity.

- Created visual checklists, reference sheets, and troubleshooting guides now used throughout the shop and in orientation sessions.

These improvements increased safety-assessment pass rates and strengthened the shop’s structured learning pathway from beginner to advanced machining skills.
