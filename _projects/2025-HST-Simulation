This was a group project focused on modeling and controlling the Hubble Space Telescope’s pitch dynamics under aerodynamic disturbances. While the project was completed as a team, I was responsible for the majority of the technical work, including deriving the torque equations, building the state-space model, implementing the PD controller in MATLAB, and running all simulations and analyses. My contributions drove the core modeling, control design, and verification efforts that formed the foundation of the project’s results.

Key Accomplishments

- Developed a single-axis pitch model using I_y, accurately representing rotational dynamics with both control and disturbance torques.  

- Designed and tuned a PD controller to maintain stable pitch orientation under aerodynamic forces.  

- Authored all MATLAB code for simulations, including state-space modeling and response analysis under disturbance scenarios.  

- Compiled the full project report, including derivations, simulations, and results, available as a PDF.  

This project demonstrates end-to-end spacecraft attitude modeling and control, with all major technical contributions handled personally, ensuring the project’s success.
