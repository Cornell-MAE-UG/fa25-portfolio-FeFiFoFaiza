I developed 3D-printed rover wheels engineered to maximize traction, structural rigidity, and performance on loose or uneven terrain. The design process involved tread-pattern research, iterative prototyping, and terrain-based validation.

Key Accomplishments

- Designed wheel structures that supported 100+ N radial loads while maintaining reliable traction in sand, gravel, and regolith simulants.

- Improved traction by 15–20% through adjustments to lug spacing, tread curvature, and deformation zones.

- Reduced prototyping time by 30% by using rapid additive manufacturing and parametric CAD workflows.

- Produced design guidelines ensuring wheel geometry aligned with suspension and drivetrain performance constraints.

The final wheel design performed reliably in incline testing, slip-ratio analysis, and obstacle-traversal trials.
